# vendor_huawei_cameron_al09
Vendor files for Huawei Mediapad M5 10.8'' copied from the /vendor on my cmr-al09.
Maybe always the latest version because m5 isn't likely to get updates in the future.

**There are some other hisi ini files and I thought they might be useful for other devices so I put them in /etc/additional/
